- Assuming that a todoData could NOT include completed
- Assuming the todo fields month and year are not required,
# but if they are provided should be validated so that year >= current year (2019) and month is between 1 & 12
- Assuming that the todo method `isWithinMonthYear` should return a boolean based on whether or not the todo's month value === given month value, and year value === given year value
- Assuming there is no validation needed for todoData being initialized or added to the program
- Assuming all inputs are the correct type and do not need to be validated
